# Bing Video YouTube Redirect Userscript

Automatically redirects Bing video embeds to YouTube and updates search page video links.

This userscript improves your Bing video experience by:
1. Redirecting embedded YouTube videos on Bing video pages to the original YouTube link.
2. Updating YouTube video links on Bing search pages to point directly to YouTube (no automatic redirect on search pages).

## Features

- Auto-redirects YouTube embedded videos from Bing video pages.
- Updates Bing search results to use direct YouTube links.
- Lightweight, runs entirely in your browser with no external dependencies.

## Installation

1. Install a userscript manager if you don’t have one:
   - Tampermonkey (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
   - Violentmonkey (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)

2. Download or copy the userscript file:
   bing-video-youtube-redirect.user.js

3. Open the file or copy the content into your userscript manager to install.

## Usage

- Visit any Bing video page: the script will automatically redirect embedded YouTube videos to YouTube.
- On Bing search pages, video links pointing to YouTube will be updated instantly to link directly to YouTube, but the page won’t redirect automatically.
